It is pertinent to state that each and every review posted on Within30 is the personal opinion of the user/reviewer only. Within30 is a neutral platform, which solely provides a means of communication between users/reviewers including users or business owners/representatives with access to business page. We are a neutral platform and we don’t arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone writes a review that isn’t true about the business, the best option for the business owner/representative would be to contact the reviewer or post a public response in order to clear up any misunderstandings. If the business believes that any particular user’s review violates Within30’s Policy, he can flag the review to our attention. Within30 may remove the review in its sole discretion if review is in violation of the Terms, or content guidelines and policies or otherwise harmful to the Services.</p>
